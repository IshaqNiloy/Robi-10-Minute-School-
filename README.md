<h3>Problem 1:</h3>
<p>You are given a 2D matrix. Find the row-wise maximum sum, which is let's say, rowMax. And then, find the column-wise maximum sum, which is let's say, colMax. Now, print the minimum between rowMax and colMax.</p>

<h3>Problem 1:</h3>
<p>You are given a string S. You need to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example if the string is “aabccaaa” the output should be “a2b1c2a3”.</p>
